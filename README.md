# Weather App

## Description

- My motivation was to create a weather app that displays current and a 5-day forecast
- I built this project to help me practice with API's, continuation of using moment, jQuery and modals
- It solves the problem of not knowing this week's weather forecast, useful when traveling within the U.S.
- I learned how to use API's and modals.

## Usage

Type in any U.S. city name and you will will be provided with that city's cureent and a 5-day future weather forecast.
